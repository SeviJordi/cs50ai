First, I created a sequential model with one process of convolution and one process of Max-pooling, in addition to a hidden layer with 128 units and a dropout rate of 0.5. This model resulted in an accuracy of 38%, which is quite poor. Because of this, I added a second convolutional layer with 60 components and a second Max-pooling step. With this approach, I achieved an accuracy of 95%, which is much better. However, when I tried to add a second hidden layer with 60 units, the results worsened. I experimented with various parameters, such as dropout rates and units in the hidden layer, but the accuracy did not improve.
